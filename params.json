{"name":"Test::Class::Moose","tagline":"Serious testing for serious Perl","body":"# Why Test::Class::Moose?\r\n\r\nIf you need to create a large application, such as a Web site, do you start writing a bunch of individual scripts, each designed to handle one URL and each handling their own database access and printing their output directly to `STDOUT`? Of course not. You'd reach for a Web framework.\r\n\r\nIf your application is complicated enough to benefit from a framework, your test suite would probably benefit from one for the same reasons.\r\n\r\n`Test::Class::Moose` isn't just for testing code written in Moose &mdash; it's for testing anything you would ordinarily write tests for. While it's fine for testing libraries, when you have a large application, `Test::Class::Moose` really shines.\r\n\r\n# Test::Class::Moose Features\r\n\r\n* Reporting\r\n* Extensibility\r\n* Tagging tests\r\n* Parallel testing\r\n* Test inheritance\r\n* Write your tests using Moose\r\n* All the testing functions and behavior from [Test::Most](https://github.com/Ovid/test--most)\r\n* Event handlers for startup, setup, teardown, and shutdown of test classes\r\n\r\n# The Zen of Application Test Suites\r\n\r\nIf you're struggling with your company's test suite, you may wish to read [The Zen of Application Test Suites](http://ovid.github.io/zen-of-test-suites/) to attain enlightenment.\r\n\r\n# Don't Be These Guys\r\n\r\n![Perl's version of waiting for a compile](http://i.imgur.com/JNfyxoo.png)\r\n\r\n*With apologies to [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/303/)*\r\n\r\n# Author\r\n\r\n`Test::Class::Moose` was designed and written by Curtis \"Ovid\" Poe <ovid@allaroundtheworld.fr>.\r\n\r\nOvid also wrote the well-reviewed book [Beginning Perl](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Perl-Curtis-Poe/dp/1118013840/) and is one of the authors of [Perl Hacks](http://www.amazon.com/Perl-Hacks-Programming-Debugging-Surviving/dp/0596526741/), along with chromatic and Dr. Damian Conway. He also wrote the test harness that ships with Perl and has commit rights to much of the Perl testing toolchain.\r\n\r\n# Contributors\r\n\r\n- Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>\r\n- Doug Bell <doug.bell@baml.com>\r\n- Gregory Oschwald <goschwald@maxmind.com>\r\n- Jonathan C.
